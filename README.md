#About Paula

Hola! My name is Paula Diaz, and I am originally from Colombia. I moved to the United States 5 years ago to learn English and to have the opportunity to accomplish my professional goals. I first moved to Seattle, I enjoyed my time in West coast very much. 4 years ago I moved to New Jersey and fall
in love with this state and with the people I have met. I love living in the States, but of course, my country holds a big piece of my heart. I am the
first generation of my family to live here, all my family is back in Colombia. I love cooking, to me cooking is a way to show people you care for them and to make them happy. I love hiking, biking, and all sorts of outdoor sports. I love traveling and I have this personal goal of visit every single state as well as every single Continent, so far I have been to 17 states. I would love to go for a Master in Computer Science, but now I am trying to focus on gaining experience in my field to be able to get a good job, so I can support myself and help my family. When I went to college my favorite courses were databases, JAVA, Web Development and Gathering, and Analysis of System Requirements.  


#About Aryaa

Hey everyone! I'm a rising senior at Rutgers- New Brunswick, and im almost done with my B.S. in CS! I am also minoring in Music, which, along with coding, is probably my life's greatest passion. In high school I was an active member of both band(I played the clarinet) and theater(I was an okay singer and dancer but a TERRIBLE actor), and the first thing I did when I came to college was join The OrphanSporks, which, in my very biased opinion, is the best acapella group at Rutgers. We're known on campus for our brightly colored shirts and our weird AF name. We do a lot of R&B, alternative, and indie covers. I'm going to link a couple of our performances and music videos because I'm annoying and want to promote my group lol. I also make beats and write original songs, and during this quarantine I've been really trying to become a better songwriter and producer. I'm hoping that maybe one day I'll become good enough to put a respectable EP on Spotify, but we will see what happens. Also, I like playing the ukulele. Also, I like dancing, specifically Latin dance! I used to be a certified Zumba instructor for Rutgers, but I stopped because I wanted to focus more on school and becoming a better developer and improving my technical skills. Besides coding and music, I like Bojack Horseman, The Office, swimming, hiking, Tacoria, writing poetry, Harry Potter, Dungeons & Dragons, Reddit, and a bunch of other stuff. I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I'm a total open book. Pls be my friend. Let's follow each other on ig, I want to stalk all of y'all on social media. My handle is @aryaas1. <3

Also I am shamelessly plugging my acapella group. Here are two links to our performances (I'm soloing one of them teehee!)
