#About Paula

Hola! My name is Paula Diaz, and I am originally from Colombia. I moved to the United States 5 years ago to learn English and to have the opportunity to accomplish my professional goals. I first moved to Seattle, I enjoyed my time in West coast very much. 4 years ago I moved to New Jersey and fall
in love with this state and with the people I have met. I love living in the States, but of course, my country holds a big piece of my heart. I am the
first generation of my family to live here, all my family is back in Colombia. I love cooking, to me cooking is a way to show people you care for them and to make them happy. I love hiking, biking, and all sorts of outdoor sports. I love traveling and I have this personal goal of visit every single state as well as every single Continent, so far I have been to 17 states. I would love to go for a Master in Computer Science, but now I am trying to focus on gaining experience in my field to be able to get a good job, so I can support myself and help my family. When I went to college my favorite courses were databases, JAVA, Web Development and Gathering, and Analysis of System Requirements.
