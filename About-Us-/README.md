I'm just a normal dude
I do normal things

Some guys have all the luck,I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep. As you could well imagine my medical bills are extremely high, but luckily I'm able to keep myself alive by selling chocolate bars
